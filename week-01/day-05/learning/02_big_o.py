# O(1)       - Constant     - Array access, hash lookup
# O(log n)   - Logarithmic  - Binary search
# O(n)       - Linear       - Single loop
# O(n log n) - Linearithmic - Merge sort, quick sort avg
# O(n^2)     - Quadratic    - Nested loops, bubble sort
# O(2^n)     - Exponential  - Naive recursive fibonacci
# O(n!)      - Factorial    - Permutations
